🎯 Project Overview
 Advisory is a student-centric advisory platform designed to help students make informed decisions about streams, courses, careers, and nearby government colleges.
It brings personalized guidance, mentorship, and opportunities into one unified ecosystem — especially for students with limited access to career counseling.

🔍 Problem Statement

Government college enrollment is declining, students lack awareness about career options, and most of them don’t have access to digital career guidance.
Surveys show that:

Students know only 7–10 career options on average.

93% of students are confused after Class 10 & 12.

Awareness about nearby government colleges is very low.

Career guidance platforms exist, but most are paid, limiting access.

Advisory solves this problem by offering a free, localized, AI-powered advisory platform.
